You create your own star and from the supernova it creates a cluster of gaz and dust, having angular momentum 

Then the clouds and gases accumulates, the way it does could be :
* at small mass:
  *  particles have a small chance to glue each other when colliding
  *  otherwise they push each other and continue their ways 
* at medium mass
  * have a small chance to merge when colliding
  *  it has more chance to break apart returning to small mass particles
* at large mass, gravity takes over and start to attract near object
  *  if an small or medium object collides with it merge withing the large object
  *  if two large object collides then either they break apart completly or loose some of their mass
